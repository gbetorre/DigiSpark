## Introduction

The USB ports, in modern computers world, are everywhere! As a matter of fact, ihey are extremely convenient but, as we'll see in this article, they also poses significant security risks.

From one hand, USB ports on PCs and Macs allow data to be exchanged between a large number of devices and the personal computer, making it easy to add peripherals without worrying about restarting the system or device recognition. Last but not least, they also provide a moderate voltage that can be used to charge low-power devices. 

However, on the other hand, these conveniences come at a price in terms of vulnerability, and every USB port is effectively an open door to the potential risk of unauthorized access to the system and the destruction of data or, worse, to the insertion of malicious code that can cause severe issues for privacy and data security.
